## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a general-purpose, document-based, distributed database that has been designed for modern application developers and the cloud era.

What does this mean is that MongoDB is a NoSQL Database that make faster and eficienty compared with the traditional SQL.

To beging with, first at all you need to install MongoDB [click here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) to install for your own operative system.

Because I'm using windows, I need to add to the path enviroment. [click here](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/) to add it for any program.

## Starting with MongoDB

In my case, the database used was provided by my teacher who created it in Atlas, which is a cloud database (from Mongo DB) therefore we needed access trough a link from him to use it in the cmd.

he first thing would be opening the command window and use the link provided, in my case this will do:
```mongodb
mongo "mongodb+srv://cluster0-cdd34.mongodb.net/next" --username YourUsernamehere password writehere
```
The password element is only write if it is required.
